## Installation

[Click Here for GitHub Repo](https://github.com/naveed-mahmoudian/PWA-text-editor)

To install this application be sure you have Node installed on your computer. Clone the repo and now you can run `npm start` to build and start the server. This will create a `dist` folder in the root directory which houses the output from Webpack. Check the `package.json` file in the root directory for all npm scripts.

NOTE: The default port is set to `3000`. To change the port, adjust the `PORT` variable at the top of the `server.js` file.
